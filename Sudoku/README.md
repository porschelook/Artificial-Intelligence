Submission from Matthew Callahan and  Suphalerk Lortaraprasert.

To run the code, run the command:
> python main.py
in your terminal. The prompt does not effect anything since we did not get to implementing the code past option 1. The evil puzzles will automatically be skipped, and results from each puzzle from the file will be shown in the terminal. 

we used python version 3.10.12
