for '1' is fully observable environments
    it will show enviroment selection and select wall types "NoWall 0 ,Wall 1 ,Random_Wall 2" 

    it will run 5x5,6x6,7x7,8x8,...14x14 size of board

    Select size of borad (type '0' is default)
    and select wall types "NoWall 0 ,Wall 1 ,Random_Wall 2"     
    
    Note***: in size 2x2 it can search on time but 3x3,4x4,5x5,...,nxn. it over time limit
